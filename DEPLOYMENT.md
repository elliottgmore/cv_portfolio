# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the CV Portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## Configuration Changes Made

1. **Vite Base Path**: Added `base: "/cv_portfolio/"` to `vite.config.ts`
2. **React Router**: Added `basename="/cv_portfolio"` to `BrowserRouter` in `App.tsx`
3. **Jekyll Disabled**: Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing

## Deployment Method: Deploy from Branch

This project is configured to use GitHub Pages' "Deploy from a branch" option, which automatically deploys when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### How it works:
1. The `dist` folder contains the built files generated by Vite
2. The `docs` folder contains a copy of the built files for GitHub Pages
3. GitHub Pages serves the built application from the `docs` folder
4. When you push changes to main, GitHub Pages automatically updates the live site

### To deploy changes:
1. Make your code changes
2. Run the build and deploy script: `./build-and-deploy.sh`
   - Or manually: Run `npm run build`, then `cp -r dist/* docs/`
3. Commit both your source changes and the updated `dist` and `docs` folders
4. Push to the main branch
5. GitHub Pages will automatically serve the updated site

### One-time GitHub Pages Setup:
1. Go to your repository's Settings â†’ Pages
2. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select branch "main" and folder "/docs"
4. Save the settings

Note: The `/docs` folder contains a copy of the built application from the `/dist` folder to satisfy GitHub Pages requirements.

## Verification

After deployment, the site should be accessible at:
`https://elliottgmore.github.io/cv_portfolio/`

The errors about 404 for `src/main.tsx` and `favicon.ico` should be resolved.
